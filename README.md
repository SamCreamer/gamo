I have turned this initial skeleton into a somewhat working game. It is a very simple game, feel free to use this source for inspiration or to learn.


THE GAME
----------

Just use arrow keys or WASD to avoid the red dots. The longer you survive, the more points you get


HOW TO INSTALL
---------------

Just clone and open index.html in any browser (or download the files and open index.html in any browser)

TODO
-----

Add power ups / boosts
