# gamo
First attempt at making a cool JavaScript game. The game is incomplete.

The point of the game is to avoid the red circles (enemies). You are the blue circle.

Right now, the only things that have been implemented are the following: 

i) All movement controls (WASD and arrow keys)
ii) Enemy generation
iii) Some trigger when collision occurs

There's no lives or levels or scoring implemented yet. Might continue this some day, not sure. 

TO USE: Just download and open index.html in a browser
